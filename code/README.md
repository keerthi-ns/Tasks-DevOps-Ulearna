# Project Deployment and Testing Guide

## Overview

This document provides instructions for deploying and testing the application, including the URLs and endpoints for frontend and backend services, and details on IAM roles and permissions required for various AWS services. This application includes a **Next.js frontend** deployed to S3 and served through CloudFront, and a **NestJS backend** deployed on EKS with Fargate, RDS, and CodePipeline integration.

---

### 1. Prerequisites

- **AWS Account**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to create AWS resources such as S3, CloudFront, EKS, CodePipeline, and RDS.
- **AWS CLI**: Install and configure with appropriate access credentials.
- **Terraform**: Ensure Terraform is installed to manage infrastructure as code.
- **Git Repository**: Ensure that the applicationâ€™s source code is stored in GitHub/GitLab and connected to CodePipeline.

---

### 2. Deployment Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd project-directory
   ```

2. **Initialize and Configure Terraform**  
   Initialize the Terraform configuration:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```
   Configure necessary variables and plan the resources:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```
   Apply the configuration to deploy AWS resources:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

3. **Verify CodePipeline**  
   Ensure CodePipeline has triggered the build and deployment processes for both the frontend and backend services. You can view the progress of the pipeline in the **AWS Console > CodePipeline**.

---

### 3. Testing the Application

1. **Frontend (Next.js)**  
   - Once the CodePipeline completes, verify that the application is live by accessing the **CloudFront Distribution URL**. This serves the Next.js application hosted on S3.
   - Navigate through different routes in the Next.js app to confirm content and performance.
  
2. **Backend (NestJS API)**  
   - Use a tool like **Postman** or **curl** to send HTTP requests to the backend API.
   - Test each CRUD operation to verify responses and data persistence in the RDS instance.

### 4. IAM Roles and Permissions

#### CodePipeline IAM Role

**Role**: `CodePipelineRole`  
**ARN**: Refer to `aws_iam_role.codepipeline_role.arn` in your Terraform output.  
**Permissions**:
  - **S3 Access**: For storing artifacts and build outputs.
  - **CodeBuild Access**: To trigger build and deployment jobs.
  - **CloudWatch Logs Access**: To enable logging for debugging pipeline execution.

#### CodeBuild IAM Role

**Role**: `CodeBuildServiceRole`  
**ARN**: Refer to `aws_iam_role.codebuild_service_role.arn` in your Terraform output.  
**Permissions**:
  - **S3 Full Access**: To fetch source code and upload artifacts.
  - **CloudWatch Logs Full Access**: To record build logs.
  - **AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess**: For pushing Docker images if using ECR.

#### EKS IAM Role (Fargate Tasks)

**Role**: `EKSFargateExecutionRole`  
**ARN**: Refer to `aws_iam_role.eks_fargate_execution_role.arn` in your Terraform output.  
**Permissions**:
  - **EKS Fargate Execution**: Provides EKS access to pull images and manage containers.
  - **CloudWatch Logs Full Access**: To log application output and container metrics.

#### Additional IAM Permissions

- **SNS Permissions**: For CloudWatch alarms, add `AmazonSNSFullAccess` to any role that needs access to send notifications.
- **RDS Access**: Add the necessary RDS permissions to any role needing database access, such as connecting or querying data.

### Conclusion

This README should guide you through the deployment and testing processes for both the frontend and backend applications, as well as the IAM permissions required. Once deployed, you should be able to access and interact with both the frontend UI and the backend API endpoints through the provided URLs.
